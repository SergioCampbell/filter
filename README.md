# Getting Started with Players APP

The project is to write a function that searches through NBA player heights
based on user input. The raw data is taken from
[here](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=nba_heights).  The data is
served in json format by the endpoint
[here](https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/).

The task is to create an application that takes a single integer input. The
application will download the raw data from the website above
(https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com) and print a list of all pairs of players
whose height in inches adds up to the integer input to the application. If no
matches are found, the application will print "No matches found"

Sample output is as follows:
```
> app 139

- Brevin Knight         Nate Robinson
- Nate Robinson         Mike Wilks
```

The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2). All edge cases
should be handled appropriately. This is _not_ a closed book test. You are
encouraged to reach out with any questions that you come across.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
